# Password Creator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reach2jeyan/PasswordsCreator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reach2jeyan/PasswordsCreator)

This desktop and Mac application is built on elektron JS to allow you to quickly either create new password or shuffle the existing password without spending much time to think about it.

Functionality:
#New Password
1. This will give you a random password either with your name or jumble of alphabets and numbers with special characters

#Existing Password
1. This will reshuffle your current password so that you can use the same password again in case of reset.

How to use it
#Windows
1. Install the exe file and follow windows installation process

#Mac
1. Drag the application file to the application folder and this will appear in the finder.
